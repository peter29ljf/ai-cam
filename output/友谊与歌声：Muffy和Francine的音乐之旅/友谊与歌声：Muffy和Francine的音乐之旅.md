"Stop!" Muffy cried. "That sounds awful, Francine!
If you can't sing you can’t ride on the float."

“Francine, did you learn the song I gave you?” asked Muffy.
“Well…” Francine explained nervously. “I tried to, but….”
“You may begin!” Muffy insisted.
Francine cleared her throat and sang a few notes.

More about Muffy’s family gathered around together.
"Thank you for sharing your song with us," Grandma said. "And
to learn about music too! Be prepared with your
best performance because there's a concert at my house."

“Oh, this is exciting!” Francine and Muffy crowd
together. “You’re so lucky!”
“I know,” she replied interrupting. “On my best friend, I think
you should sing her song I wrote. It’s a tribute to him.”
