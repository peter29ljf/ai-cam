**Bugs Are Insects**

But a ladybug’s mouth doesn't look like a beak. Its head isn't shaped like a triangle. A ladybug isn’t a bug at all! It is a beetle. Beetles are insects with a pair of hard wings you can’t see through that hides a second pair of clear wings. The hard wings make a straight line down the top of the abdomen when they are closed.

Now we know that a ladybug is an insect. But is it really a bug? We sometimes call insects bugs. Many people think the two words mean the same thing, but they don’t. A bug is an insect with a mouth like a beak and a head that forms a triangle. A stinkbug is a bug, and a bedbug, and so is a water strider, even though it doesn't have the word "bug" in its name.

Now look at a spider. Is it an insect? It has an external skeleton. But count its legs. How many does it have? Now count how many body parts it has. A spider has eight legs, not six. Its body is divided into two parts, not three. So it is not an insect. A spider is an an arachnid. Scorpions and daddy longlegs are arachnids too.

But all insect bodies are divided into three parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. There are six legs attached to the thorax. Anything that has six legs and three body parts is an insect. A ladybug has six legs and three body parts. Is it an insect?

Many insects have two pairs of wings and a pair of antennae. Sometimes the antennae are long, like those of crickets or butterflies. Sometimes they are short, like those of beetles.

Insects come in many shapes, sizes, and colors. They don’t all look alike, but there's a way to tell if something is an insect. Count its legs. Count how many parts make up its body.

There are many kinds of insects living all around us. Ants are insects. So are crickets and mosquitoes. So are butterflies and bees.

Is a ladybug an insect? All insects have external skeletons. You have a hard skeleton inside, with parts that move. Your body holds you up and helps give your body its shape. But an insect has a hard skeleton on the outside, with parts that move. The skeleton is like a shell around its body. It holds the insect up and gives its body its shape. A ladybug has an external skeleton. Does that mean it’s an insect?

Maybe not. All insects have external skeletons, but not all animals with external skeletons are insects. Crabs, lobsters, shrimps, and scorpions have external skeletons too, but they are not insects.
